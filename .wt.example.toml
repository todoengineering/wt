# Example local project configuration file for wt (worktree CLI)
# 
# This file should be placed in the root of your Git repository as .wt.toml
# Local configuration overrides global configuration.
#
# All configuration is optional.

# Override the global worktrees location for this specific project
# Useful if you want to store worktrees for this project in a different location
